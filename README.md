# Testing the feed reeder

The feedreader.js file uses Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/), a framework for testing. The file is found in the folder jasmine/spec/. Feedreader.js runs several tests on on the feed reader application in this file. 

# How it works

Start in the root directory and navigate to jasmine/spec/feadreader.js. To see the results of the automated tests in the file, open feedreader.js in a browser. The results should run below the feed reader. All the tests should pass initially. 

As you make changes to the files, refresh feedreader.js in the browser periodically. If any of your changes break one of the elements for which the tests are checking, the results will show which test has been broken and the line on which that test is so that you can go about resolving that issue.
